# From sequences to functions and their limits in $\mathbb{R}_{\pm\infty}$:

>[!abstract] Sequence limit
>A point $x$ of $\mathbb{R}_{\pm\infty}$ is a limit of a real sequence $(x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ 
>if for any neighborhood $V$ of $x$ for some neighborhood $U$ of $+\infty$ holds $(x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}(U)\subseteq V$.

>[!abstract] Function limit
>A point $y$ of $\mathbb{R}_{\pm \infty}$ is a limit of a real function $f:D\to \mathbb{R}$ when $x$ tending to $d\in \mathbb{R}_{\pm \infty}$ (notation $\displaystyle y = \lim_{x\to d}f(x)$),
>if for any neighborhood $V$ of $y$ for some neighborhood $U$ of $d$ holds $f(U)\subseteq V$.
