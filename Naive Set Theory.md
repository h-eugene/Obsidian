# Basic elements:

> [!abstract] Naive definition
> A set is an unordered collection of things (not counting multiplicities), its elements.
> **Description:**
> *List* $X = \{x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{n}\}$
> *Rule* $X = \{x\ |$ some condition on $x$ holds$\}$

> [!abstract] Extension Principal (Leibniz)
> Two sets equal if and only if they have the same elements.
> $$A=B$$

>[!abstract] Subset
>If every element of a set $A$ is also a element of $B$, then we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, and write $$A\subseteq B$$
>If $A\subseteq B$ but $A\neq B$, we write $A\subsetneq B$ and say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$.
>$$A=B \texttt{ iff both } A\subseteq B \texttt{ and } B\subseteq A$$

>[!abstract] Empty set
>The empty set is the empty list $$\emptyset = \{\}$$

>[!abstract] Universal set
>The universal set $\mathbb{U}$ is a fixed set such that all considered sets of  given problem are its subsets.

>[!abstract] Complement
>For any set $A$, the **complement** of $A$ is the set $$\overline{A} = \{x\ |\ x\in \mathbb{U} \wedge x\not\in A\}$$

>[!abstract] Intersection 
>For any sets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, the intersection of $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ is the set $$x\in A_{1} \vee A_{2} \text{ iff } (x\in A_{1})\wedge (x\in A_{2})$$

>[!abstract] Union
>For any sets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, the union of $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ is the set
>$$x\in A_{1}\vee A_{2} \text{ iff } (x\in A_{1})\vee (x\in A_{2})$$

>[!abstract] Difference 
>For any sets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ the difference of $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ is the set 
>$$x\in A_{1} \text{ \\ } A_{2} \text{ iff } (x\in A_{1}) \wedge (x\not \in A_{2}) $$
>$$x\in A_{1} \text{ \\ } A_{2} = A_{1}\wedge \overline{A_{2}}$$
