# Basic elements:

> [!abstract] Naive definition
> A set is an unordered collection of things (not counting multiplicities), its elements.
> **Description:**
> *List* $X = \{x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{n}\}$
> *Rule* $X = \{x\ |$ some condition on $x$ holds$\}$

> [!abstract] Extension Principal (Leibniz)
> Two sets equal if and only if they have the same elements.
> $$A=B$$

>[!abstract] Subset
>If every element of a set $A$ is also a element of $B$, then we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, and write $$A\subseteq B$$
>If $A\subseteq B$ but $A\neq B$, we write $A\subsetneq B$ and say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$.
>$$A=B \texttt{ iff both } A\subseteq B \texttt{ and } B\subseteq A$$

>[!abstract] Empty set
>The empty set is the empty list $$\emptyset = \{\}$$
