### 1) What does Mathematical Analysis study? (Compare with high school algebra.) How do you understand terms “first-order theory” and “second-order theory”? Give examples of the first-, second- and (optionally) third-order statements in Mathematical Analysis.

#### Mathematical Analysis vs. High School Algebra:

_Mathematical Analysis_ is a branch of mathematics that deals with limits, derivatives, integrals, sequences, and functions. It focuses on understanding the properties of real and complex numbers, exploring how these numbers behave when undergoing operations such as differentiation or integration. Analysis also includes concepts of continuity, convergence, and infinite series. It's essentially the rigorous framework behind calculus, providing the theoretical foundation to explain why various calculus techniques work.

_High School Algebra_, on the other hand, deals with manipulating algebraic expressions and solving equations. It covers topics like polynomials, linear and quadratic equations, systems of equations, and basic properties of numbers. While algebra is more about finding solutions to given problems, analysis goes deeper into understanding the underlying behaviors and theoretical underpinnings.

In short, algebra helps solve equations, whereas analysis helps understand how those solutions behave as part of a broader system, often dealing with infinite processes.

#### First-order and Second-order Theory:

- A **_first-order theory_** deals with quantifying over elements of a set. In first-order logic, you use quantifiers like "for all" (∀) and "there exists" (∃) to refer to specific elements within a domain. In Mathematical Analysis, first-order theories can be used to describe properties of numbers, sequences, and functions without referring to sets of sets or functions of functions.

- A _**second-order theory_** allows quantification over sets, functions, or relations. This means that second-order logic can make statements about properties of entire sets or functions, not just individual elements. It’s more expressive than first-order logic, which allows it to define concepts like completeness in real numbers more formally.

**Examples in Mathematical Analysis**:

1. **First-order Statement**:
    
    - $\forall x\in \mathbb{R},\ \exists y\in \mathbb{R}: y>x$
    - This is first-order because it quantifies over individual real numbers.
2. **Second-order Statement**:
    
    - "Every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound."
    - This is a second-order statement since it talks about properties of sets of real numbers, not just individual elements.
3. **Third-order Statement** (optional):
    
    - Third-order logic would involve quantifying over sets of sets or similar more complex constructions, but in mathematical analysis, such constructs are rarely used directly. An example could be:
    - "There is a set `S` of sets of real numbers such that for each set in `S`, the union is bounded."
    - Such statements are more abstract and less common, but they push the idea of quantification even further.
