# Sequences and their limits:
- A (real) sequences is a total function $(x_{n})_{n\in N}:\ \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ usually presented as $x_{0}, x_{1},x_{2},...$
- A real number $x\in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a limit of a sequences $(x_{n})_{n\in N}$, (notation $x=\lim_{n\rightarrow \inf} x_{n}$)
