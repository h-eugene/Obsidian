## 1. Definition, simple proofs:

### Let $V = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\}$ be a set of vectors. Give a definition of a span $S(V)$:

The **span** of a set of vectors $S = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\} \subseteq V$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$:
$$\text{span}(S) = \left\{w \in V:w=\sum^{n}_{k=1}c_{k},v_{k},\right\}$$
