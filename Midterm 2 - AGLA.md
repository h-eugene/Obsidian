## 1. Definition, simple proofs:

### Let $V = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\}$ be a set of vectors. Give a definition of a span $S(V)$:

The **span** of a set of vectors $S = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\} \subseteq V$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$:
$$\text{span}(S) = \left\{w \in V:w=\sum^{n}_{k=1}c_{k},v_{k},\ \forall c_{k} \in \mathbb{R}\right\}.$$
In this context, any vector $w \in \text{span}(S)$ can ve expressed as a linear combination of the vectors $v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}$, where the coefficients $c_{k}$ are real numbers.
