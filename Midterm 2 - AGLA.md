## 1. Definition, simple proofs:

### Let $V = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\}$ be a set of vectors. Give a definition of a span $S(V)$:

The **span** of a set of vectors $S = \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\} \subseteq V$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$:
$$\text{span}(S) = \left\{w \in V:w=\sum^{n}_{k=1}c_{k},v_{k},\ \forall c_{k} \in \mathbb{R}\right\}.$$
In this context, any vector $w \in \text{span}(S)$ can ve expressed as a linear combination of the vectors $v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}$, where the coefficients $c_{k}$ are real numbers.

### What is the geometrical interpretation of the magnitude of $a \times b$?

The magnitude of the cross product $a \times b$ of two vectors $a$ and $b$ can be interpreted geometrically as the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors:

$$|a \times b| = |a||b|\sin \theta,$$
where:
- $|a|$ and $|b|$ are the magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors $a$ and $b$,
- $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $a$ and $b$
