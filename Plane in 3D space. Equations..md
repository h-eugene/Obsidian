# General Equation of a Plane:

>[!abstract] In a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system
>$$Ax+By + Cz + D = 0$$
>$x,y,z$ are arbitrary coordinates of a point on a plane.

> [!abstract] Given $M_{1}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is a point in plane:
> $$Ax_{1}+By_{1}+Cz_{1} + D = 0$$

>[!important] We get *the general equation* of the plane:
>$$A(x-x_{1}) + B(y-y_{1}) + C(z-z_{1}) = 0$$

# Vector form:
![](Pasted%20image%2020241017140250.png)
$$r-r_{1}= [x-x_{1}, y-y_{1}, z-z_{1}]^{\top}$$
Hence, the general equation of the plane $A(x-x_{1}) + B(y-y_{1}) + C(z-z_{1}) = 0$ 
Can be presented in the vector form:
$$(r-r_{1})\cdot n = 0, \text{ where $n = \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C
\end{bmatrix}$}$$
If we expand the vector form of the plane equation, we will obtain the general form of the equation again.
