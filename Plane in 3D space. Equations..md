# General Equation of a Plane:

>[!abstract] In a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system
>$$A_{1}x+By + Cz + D = 0$$
>$x,y,z$ are arbitrary coordinates of a point on a plane.

> [!abstract] Given $M_{1}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is a point in plane:
> $$Ax_{1}+By_{1}+Cz_{1} + D = 0$$

>[!important] We get *the general equation* of the plane:
>$$A(x-x_{1}) + B(y-y_{1}) + C(z-z_{1}) = 0$$

# Vector form:
![](Pasted%20image%2020241017140250.png)
$$r-r_{1}= [x-x_{1}, y-y_{1}, z-z_{1}]^{\top}$$
Hence, the general equation of the plane $A(x-x_{1}) + B(y-y_{1}) + C(z-z_{1}) = 0$ 
Can be presented in the vector form:
$$(r-r_{1})\cdot n = 0, \text{ where $n = \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C
\end{bmatrix}$}$$
If we expand the vector form of the plane equation, we will obtain the general form of the equation again.

>Consider arbitrary vector $r = [x,y,z]$. Then three vectors $r-r_{1},p,q$ are coplanar.
>$$\begin{vmatrix}x-x_{1}&y-y_{1}&z-z_{1} \\ p_{x}&p_{y}&p_{z} \\ q_{x}&q_{y}&q_{z}

# Angle Between Two Planes:

# Distance From a Point To a Plane:

- Equation of plane: $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$
- Point $Q(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is not in plane.
- Point $M(x,y,z)$ is an arbitrary point in plane
![|350](Pasted%20image%2020241019161325.png)
$$\displaylines{d = \frac{|n \cdot \overline{QM}|}{\|n\|}=\\ 
= \left|\frac{A(x-x_{1}) + B(y-y_{1}) + C(z-z_{1})}{\sqrt{A^{2}+ B^{2} +C^{2}}}\right|}$$

# Relative Position of Planes:
![400](Pasted%20image%2020241019161641.png)
- The planes are parallel and coincide if they have the same normal and $D$ coefficient
- The planes are parallel and not coincide if they have the same normal and the different $D$ coefficients
- The planes are not parallel if they have the different normal vectors.
---
# Relative Position of a Plane and a Line:

$\begin{cases}Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 \\ A_{1}x + B_{1}y + C_{1}z + D_{1} = 0\\ A_{2}x + B_{2}y + C_{2}z + D_{2}= 0\end{cases}$

There are three possible cases:
- If the rank of the coefficient matrix equals $3$, then $M_{0}(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is the point of intersection of the plane and the line.
- If the system is consistent, and the rank of the coefficient matrix equals $2$, then the line $L$ lies in the plane $P$.
- If system is inconsistent then the line $L$ is parallel to the plane $P$.
