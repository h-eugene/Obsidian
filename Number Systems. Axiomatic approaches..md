# Peano Postulates (Axioms):
- Peano axioms (Dedekind-Peano axioms or the Peano postulates), are axioms for the natural numbers presented by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano  in 1889.
- We introduce Peano axioms with operation "+1" only while addition and multiplication may be introduced as derived operations.
- It is usually assumed that 1 is the first natural number, but we will assume that 0 is the first natural number. (However, it is always necessary and possible to agree.)
- The number following (by "+1" operation) any natural is also a natural; if a natural number $x$ immediately follows both the number $y$ and the number $z$, then $y$ and $z$ are equal.
  
> [!abstract] Axioms of Induction: 
  If a proposition $P(n)$
  >- (base of induction) proved for a given natural number $m$ (for example, for m = 2023)
  >- and if (step of induction) from the hypothesis (assumption) that $P(k)$ is true for a natural number $k$, it follows that it is true for the natural following $k$ (i.e, for (k+1)),
>
>then the proposition $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers starting from $m$.

# Tarski's axiomatization
- Alfred Tarski set out (in 1936) an axiomatization of the real numbers and their arithmetic, using the following signature:
	- $\mathbb{R}$ for the set of reals,
	- infix "<" for a total binary relation on $\mathbb{R}$,
	- infix "+" for addition over $\mathbb{R}$,
	- and the constant $1$.
- We intraoduce Tarski axioms with operation "+" only while multiplication may be introduced asd derived operation.
