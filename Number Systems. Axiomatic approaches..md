# Peano Postulates (Axioms):
- Peano axioms (Dedekind-Peano axioms or the Peano postulates), are axioms for the natural numbers presented by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano  in 1889.
- We introduce Peano axioms with operation "+1" only while addition and multiplication may be introduced as derived operations.
- It is usually assumed that 1 is the first natural number, but we will assume that 0 is the first
- **Axioms of Induction**: If a proposition $P(n)$
	- (base of induction) proved for a given natural number $m$ (for example, for m = 2023)
	- and if (step of induction) from the hypothesis (assumption) that $P(k)$ is true for a natural number $k$, it follows that it is true for the natural following $k$ (i.e, for (k+1)),
	then the proposition $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers starting from $m$.
