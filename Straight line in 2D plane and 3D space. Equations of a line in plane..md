>[!abstract] Locus
>"When a point moves so as to satisfy some geometrical condition or conditions, the path traced out by the point is called the **locus** of the point."
>
>**Example:**
>- Suppose a point $P(x,y)$ moves such that its distances from two fixed points $A(2,3)$ and $B(5,-3)$ are equal. Then the geometrical law is lengths $PA = PB$ hence hence $PA^{2}= PB^{2}$
>  $$(x-2)^{2} + (y-3)^{2} = (x-5)^{2}+ (y+3)^{2} \Rightarrow$$
>  $$2x - 4y - 7 = 0 - \text{locus is a straight line}$$
