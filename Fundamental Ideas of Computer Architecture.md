  *For this sample code, we aim at predicting ("speculating") 3 cases with the highest probability to occur.*
- **Dependability via redundancy**
  *Some redundant (or "spare") components are introduced (e.g CPU or memory unit) to increase the reliability of a computer platform (e.g in a spacecraft);*
- **Make the common case fast**
  *The computer platform should be optimized for the most common use case expected*
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**
  *Finite State Machine $-$ a (finite) set of states and transitions between them; a convenient way to model systems behavior.*
