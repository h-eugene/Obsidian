Sequences and their limits:

##### assistant
 Based on your notes, it seems that you have written about sequences and their limits. Sequences are a fundamental concept in mathematics, which are a set of numbers written in a specific order. The limit of a sequence is the value that the sequence approaches as the index (or term number) approaches infinity. In other words, it's the value that the sequence gets closer and closer to, but never actually reaches. The study of sequences and their limits is important in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and number theory.
