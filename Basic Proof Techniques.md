# Theorems:
>[!abstract] Theorem $A\to B$ 
>$A$ is called a *sufficient condition* for $B$,
>$B$ is called a *necessary condition* for $A$.

>[!abstract] Theorem $A\leftrightarrow B$ 
>$A$ is called a *sufficient and necessary condition* for $B$.
>$A\leftrightarrow B \equiv (A\to B) \wedge (B\to A)$
