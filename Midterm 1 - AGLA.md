## Theory:

1. Vectors $v_{1}, v_{2},...,v_{n}$ are linearly independent if for $\lambda_{1},\ \lambda_{2},...,\ \lambda_{n}\in\mathbb{R},\ \lambda_{1}v_{1} + \lambda_{2}v_{2} +\ ...\ + \lambda_{n}v_{n} = 0$ if and only if $\lambda_{1}=\lambda_2=...=\lambda_{n}=0.$  
2. Condition of coplanarity of three vectors:
   Three vectors are complanar if their scalar triple product is equal to $0$:
   $$\displaylines{a \cdot (b \times c) = 0}$$
